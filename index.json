Language involves dynamic processes and changes over time. How can language change be comprehensively integrated in formal semantic theories? What diachronic forces do shape functionally complex linguistic domains? In my PhD project, I investigate these questions by focusing on indefinite pronouns and determiners across languages. My approach is to develop logical frameworks able to capture the complex landscape of indefinites cross-linguistically, integrating their distribution, functional restrictions and diachronic pathways. I am particularly interested in modal inferences phenomena (free choice, ignorance, specificity, ...) of indefinites.

We focus on free choice indefinites and in particular on the Italian qualsiasi. Our aim is to reconstruct the grammaticalization path of this item and understand how diachronic data might shed some light on existing semantic theories of free choice. We employ corpus-based tools to build a database containing occurrences of qualsiasi from its origin and early forms to its current usage. We show that qualsiasi emerged from a particular unconditional construction and we outline the different stages which led to its grammaticalization. We analyze the compatibility of our diachronic study with formal accounts of free choice inferences, with a focus on Alternative Semantics analyses for indefinite pronouns and so-called grammatical theories of free choice. Our work shows that an integration between formal semantics and historical linguistics is fruitful and worth pursuing.","tags":["paper"],"title":"Indefinites and Free Choice: When the Past Matters","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marco Degano","Âê≥ÊÅ©ÈÅî"],"categories":["Demo","ÊïôÁ®ã"],"content":"Overview The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.
