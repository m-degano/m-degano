      <p>Welcome!</p>
      <p>
        I am a 4th-year PhD student at the
        <a href="https://www.illc.uva.nl/" target="_blank">Institute for Logic, Language and Computation</a> (ILLC)
        of the <a href="https://www.uva.nl/" target="_blank">University of Amsterdam</a> (UvA), supervised by
        <a href="https://www.marialoni.org/" target="_blank">Maria Aloni</a> and
        <a href="https://www.florisroelofsen.com/" target="_blank">Floris Roelofsen</a>. Before that, I completed my master's degree in Logic at the University of Amsterdam (2017 - 2019) and my bachelor's degree in Philosophy at the University of Padua (2014 - 2017).
      </p>
      <p>
        Language involves dynamic processes and changes over time. How can language change be comprehensively integrated
        in formal semantic theories? What diachronic forces shape functionally complex linguistic domains?
      </p>
      <p>
        In my PhD project, I investigate these questions by focusing on indefinite pronouns and determiners across
        languages. My approach is to develop logical frameworks able to capture the complex landscape of indefinites
        cross-linguistically, integrating their distribution, functional restrictions, and diachronic pathways. I am
        particularly interested in modal inferences phenomena (free choice, ignorance, specificity, etc.) of indefinites.
