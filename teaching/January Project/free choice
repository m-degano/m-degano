## Overview 
<p style="text-align:justify">
Free choice inferences pose a challenge to classical treatment of disjunction. 
</p>

1. Adam might be in Paris or in London $[\lozenge (\alpha \vee \beta)]$ 

2. ‚áù Adam might be in Paris and he might in London $[\lozenge \alpha \wedge \lozenge \beta]$

<p style="text-align:justify">
The inference from (1) to (2) is invalid in classical modal logic, but free choice inferences are quite pervasive in natural language.  We will examine how the Bilateral State Based Modal Logic (BSML) developed by Aloni (2021) solves this problem.
